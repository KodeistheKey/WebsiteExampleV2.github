New icons are needed for custom nabar while within "Github," no support for the current icons apparently(Custom Navbar code is still intact and working wihthout bugs when i switched to the Github dev enviornment. After that links need to be added to the Navbar to differnt sections of the same page. Tried to add scroll box unsuccesfuly to link differnet sections of the webpage,so alternative is to create differnt html pages and link them.
